# WaveLab
Synthesis and visualization of waveforms in real-time.
This project utilizes three foundational JUCE audio classes: the AudioDeviceManager, AudioSourcePlayer and AudioSource. The app connects these components together to form a flow of audio samples that originate at the audio source and end at the host's hardware output device.
